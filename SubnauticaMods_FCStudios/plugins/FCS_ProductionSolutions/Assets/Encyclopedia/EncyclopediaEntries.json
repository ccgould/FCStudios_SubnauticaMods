The Hydroponic Harvester requires growable samples (seeds, cuttings, etc) so the Alterra Matter Analyzer will reject whole products that cannot germinate or otherwise regrow whole products.\n\nFor Non-living Samples, the Alterra Replicator (see Production > Replicator) will build your replicated samples from the ground up.\n\nRecorded DNA Samples are transferred to the appropriate devices using a PDA backchannel. The Matter Analyzer does not interact with the Data Storage System, and both the Hydroponic Harvester and the Replicator receive DNA Sample recordings when your PDA is in range.\n\nThe Matter Analyzer only needs to scan an item once and will not accept items it has already scanned.\n\nThe Scanned Item Database is available for viewing via on-screen option.\n\nThe Alterra Matter Analyzer: never again wonder where that stain came from.",

Some programming options will increase power and lubricant usage, and programming options are subject to safety limitations due to material tolerances. Remember: you are financially liable for any damage done by custom programming. \n\nExample, Connecting an Autonomous, DSS-Aware Unit: \n  - Note the Base Designation (e.g., BS011). You can find this from the home screen of the FCStudios PDA and the C48 Terminal, just to the right of the base name in the display.\n  - From the Autonomous Unit\u2019s Settings, go to the Programming page. \n  - Select Templates and choose the \u2018Connect to base\u2019 template. \n  - Replace the \u201c{BaseID}\u201d portion of the template with the Base Designation (e.g., \u201cos.ConnectToBase(BS011);\u201d ) and press Execute Function.\n\nThe Alterra Deep Driller: Heavy Duty: if you need a hole, think Alterra Deep Drillers.

Combining multiple programming modes with Altera SwarmTech Assistive Manufacturing, the Alterra Auto Crafter leverages the Alterra Data Storage technology and Alterra Invisobot Fetch-and-Store technology to create a Fully Hands-Off Manufacturing Workflow. \n\nThe Auto Crafter will automatically retrieve the necessary materials from and return manufactured items to the various Base storage options available. The Data Storage Network is the most efficient option, however physical storage and disconnected DSS sub-node devices, such as an Alterra Remote Storage unit, that have physical access options can also be used. The Auto Crafter will dispatch Alterra Invisobots where physical transport is needed.\n\nWarning: Do not attempt to interfere with Alterra Invisobots as they are very shy. Attempts to do so will void all Auto Crafter warranties and is a direct violation of the CyberMind Emotional Damage laws which are strictly interpreted and carry heavy, statutory financial penalties and prison time. Remember: if you happen to notice an Invisobot, NO YOU DID NOT NOTICE an Alterra Invisobot.\n\nWhen near an Auto Crafter, it will project some basic information about it\u2019s current settings onto your always-up display. \n\n\nUsing Altera SwarmTech Assistive Manufacturing will decrease the amount of time needed to complete manufacturing runs. It can be used in any manufacturing mode but was designed with limited runs in mind. Simply open the Assist Settings and select any idle Auto Crafters from the list. Note: Auto Crafters selected for Assistance will flag themselves as busy even if the Parent Auto Crafter is not crafting since the SwarmTech technology has configured them to work as a single unit. When an Auto Crafter is in SwarmTech Assist mode, the will display an informational dialog instead of a programming interface.\n\nProgramming an Auto Crafter is easy and intuitive. Simply select the item to be manufactured, the mode of manufacture, and engage.\n\nThere are crafting modes, Fixed Amount and Continuous Operation.\n\nIn the Fixed Amount mode, the specified number of items will be created and then the program will end.\n\nIn Continuous Operation mode, the Auto Crafter remains in operation until the program is canceled. There are two modes of Continuous Operation to suit your needs.\n\n\nThe Infinite mode will, as the name suggests, manufacture the selected item so long as there are the required materials and space to put the completed item. This is useful when the supply of materials is restricted or when you really, really want to fill up every nook and cranny of your base with a specific item.\n\nThe Maintain Inventory mode will monitor the Base inventory and craft the selected item when the Base inventory falls below the specified number. This is an ideal mode for frequently used items or when Base inventory space is constrained and making large batches in advance is disadvantageous. \n\nThe Alterra Auto Crafter: don\u2019t spend your time in front of the Fabricator, spend it in comfort and style: relaxing in your Alterra Couch with your Alterra Television, enjoying drinks and snacks from the Alterra Peeper Lounge.",
