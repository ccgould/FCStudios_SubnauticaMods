Simply deposit up to 10 minerals chunks into its hopper and it will immediately begin processing. Your Local Alterra Account will be automatically credited when ore processing is complete. The compensation for ore delivery is determined by a credit matrix based on available planetary mineral scans and the latest available mineral market price update. (Your mission may have secured different mineral market price matrices so be sure check what \u201cOptions\u201d you have available)\n\nThe Ore Consumer interface will show the ores being processed, time till the current ore is processed, and the value of the remaining items being processed. Processing Speeds follow the Min-Low-High-Max Alterra Standard and power usage, also displayed, increases with processing speed. Changes in production speed take effect on the next ore processed.\n\nNota Bene: In an emergency, Alterra Ore Consumers can be constructed from local materials. Remember that materials you gather are the property of the Alterra Corporation and you will be liable to reimburse the full market price for materials you use.\n\nWarning: Ore Consumers are extremely loud and can vibrate the air and fluid around them which may induce feelings of nausea.

The hard part is over. If you are reading this and have just arrived at a remote Alterra Facility: Congratulations! The hard part is just starting.\n\nThis operating mode has one directive: to ensure you never feel abandoned by Alterra Corp.\n\nThe Alterra Hub and Alterra Hub Fabricator Facility bring you:\n  - high-quality goods & services at excellent prices\n  - a clear conscience, knowing you won't accidentally use a licensed item without paying royalties\n  - the peace of mind that comes with paying your debts on time\n\nThe Fabricator and Builder Tool are designed to recreate Products from Alterra-Kits (made with Alterra Pre-Packaged Matter Technology) but can be adapted to use local materials in an emergency. Adaptability to planetary environments depends on the available materials, making some environments more challenging, or more deadly, than others. (Remember that materials you gather are the property of the Alterra Corporation and you will be liable to reimburse the full market price for all the materials you use.)\n\nRather than cobbling together specific, possibly hard to find, local materials, the Alterra Hub lets you purchase Alterra-Kits and Products from an authorized Alterra Hub Fabrication Facility using your Local Account Balance. (Please note that your Local Account Balance and Alterra Account Balance will be merged when you enter an Authorized Alterra Network.)\n\nThe Builder Tool will reformat your Alterra-Kits into your selected Product at your desired location. With Alterra Hub, you will never fear dying in need of a hunk of molybdenum while floating on an ocean of mercury (subject to available Local Alterra Credit).\n\nDue to an emergency or local working conditions, you may not have easy access to your Alterra Project Coordinator to provide you Job Assignments or authorize payments. In light of this, the Alterra Hub will use available mineral scans and the latest available mineral-market price update to set a credit-bounty on local ores and minerals suitable for the Alterra Ore Consumer (see: Alterra Hub > Alterra Ore Consumer).\n\nCollecting vital materials for Alterra Corporation along with diligent work in your Job Assignment will let you build your Local Account balance and service your debts in a timely manner.\n\nPsychological Health Notice: Not paying your debts has been shown to lead to anxiety and depression.
